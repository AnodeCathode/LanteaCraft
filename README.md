SGCraft-Reloaded
================
Jenkins: http://neo.pc-logix.com:8080/job/SGCraft-Reloaded/

Update to Greg's SGCraft for 1.6.4 compatability.
Included config option to disable Generating gates under desert Pyramids, GenerateStructures=false will disable them.

Added support for ComputerCraft dialing to the gate directly via either the Controller, or the Gate base.

Methods are: dial("address"), connect("address"), disconnect(), isConnected(), isDialing(), listMethods(), Stargate base blocks can also use getAddress() to get the gate address.

Switched to Delta NP SGCraft Textures, thanks http://www.deltastrium.com/ for the Awesome textures!


TODO:

Adding a new gate model, Atlantis along with a DHD for it.

-DONE!- Adding a Milky Way DHD model instead of a block.

Powering gates with IC2, UE, or BuildCraft power.

Possibly using Naquadah for power generation.
